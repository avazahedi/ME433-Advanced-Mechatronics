Breakfast quesadillas are super easy to make, customizable, and delicious. Here's how I typically make mine:

### Ingredients
- 1 flour tortilla
- Shredded cheese (however much and whatever kind you like)
- 2 eggs
- Spinach
- Diced bell pepper
- Diced onion
- Diced tomato
- Greek yogurt (as a sour cream substitute, don't knock it 'til you try it)
- Avocado or guacamole


### Instructions
1. Heat pan to medium-low heat on stove.
2. Scramble eggs. Season with salt & pepper as desired. Set aside.
3. Put tortilla in pan for about a minute. Then flip.
4. Put shredded cheese over the whole tortilla and put the lid on the pan so the cheese melts. Leave until cheese has sufficiently melted.
5. Add scrambled eggs and veggies to one half of the tortilla. 
6. Fold the tortilla in half inside the pan, covering the eggs and veggies. Increase the heat to medium-high. 
7. Leave for a few minutes or until the pan-side has browned to your liking. Then flip and leave for a few more minutes.
8. Serve with sides, e.g. yogurt and avocado.

Enjoy!
